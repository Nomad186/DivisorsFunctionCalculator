# DivisorsFunctionCalculator
A program for calculating the divisor function

A script to find the "Sigma" (divisors function) of any number. 
To find the "Aliquot Sum" replace "n + 1" on line 4 with just "n"


Wiki Article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function

****************************************
ONLY FINDS THE SUM TO THE 1ST POWER OF X
****************************************
I might add an option to do it with xth powers but currently only does it with 1st power





Also gives a list of multiples for any number so if you want to find that just print "nMultiples"
